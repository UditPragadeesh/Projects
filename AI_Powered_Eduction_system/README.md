# AI POWERED EDUCATION SYSTEM

This project focuses on creating a application to help teachers in understanding students. Every student is different and analysing each student individually is a task on its own.
This app has different features to analyse each student's performance,learning style,skills etc to better guide them.


## Features

- ###  Pass/Fail Predictor: 

    This model predicts how a student is expected to perform in a given test. Based on previous test performance.
- ###  Score Predictor

    This model predicts a student's future score based on his previous perfomances. 
- ###  Learning style Predictor

    This model classifies students based on their learning styles.
- ###  Dropout Risk analysing

    This model shows the risk of a student dropping out of class.
- ###  Topic Detector

    This model is used to detect the topic of paragraphs provided.
- ###  Digit Recognition

    This model recognizes digit based on the image provided
- ###  Topic summarizer

    This model summarizes the long texts to explain the text in short.

## RUNNING APPLICATION

To run app, use command

```bash
   streamlit run Streamlit_app\Introduction.py
